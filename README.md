# PasswordManager
Python based UI - Password Manager
Using Tkinter, I have created a password manager UI which can store, save and generate passwords for any login credentials online. The Ui has a search feature which will search the dictionary of information saved. As of current the information is being saved in a .txt file. The generation of passwords uses list comprehension to search through an array of all possible letters, both lower and upper case. I have then two more list comprehensions that have numbers and characters. They are all randomized and then the string is randomized to create a new password each time. 
The password generated will also be saved to the copy on pressing of generate password box. 
The email I have elected not to clear after each addition as the email is likely to be the same for each user.
